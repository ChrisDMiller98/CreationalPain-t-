# CreationalPain-t-
I decided to implement the Decorator pattern into this program because I thought that would be easiest.
I did this by adding many more colors and options for brush sizes on top of the existing implementation.
This repository has replaced the original paint assignment (PA2).
If possible I would like the regrade to be for PA 2, the only difference between this and the original PA 2 is there were only 4 colors (black, yellow, red, and blue) and only three pen sizes (small, medium, and large).
If this is not possible I would like the regrade to be for PA 3, it is labelled in my repositories as: Paint-Breaking-into-Main.
